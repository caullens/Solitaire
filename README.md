# Solitaire
A Solitaire game template in HTML5

## Bundling
The source code in the src directory is bundled into a single file using **Browserify**.  The Browserify tools must first be installed on your system:

```$ npm install -g browserify``` (for OSX and linus users, you may need to preface this command with ```sudo```)

Once installed, you can bundle the current source with the command:

```$ browserify src/app.js -o bundle.js```

Remember, the browser must be refreshed to receive the changed javascript file.

## Watching

You may prefer to instead _watch_ the files for changes using **Watchify**.  This works very similarily to Browserify.  It first must be installed:

```$ npm install -g watchify``` (again, ```sudo``` may need to be used on linux and OSX platforms)

Then run the command:

```watchify src/app.js -o bundle.js```

The bundle will automatically be re-created every time you change a source file.  However, you still need to refresh your browser for the changed bundle to take effect.
